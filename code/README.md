# Bachelor thesis 2020

Note from the author: here you kind find my study on musical timbre and compatibility among music instruments. 
During this project we defined a mathematical tool to evaluate the acoustic compatiblity between music instruments playing especific pieces.

Sadly I did not structure the code properly back then, so it is kind of a mess to find which file contains each function.
The file main.m contains the final comparison of the spectrograms played by each instrument.

I intend to re-structure this project in the future, but sadly I dont have the time nor the Matlab license right now :/
