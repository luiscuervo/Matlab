Study of acoustic compatibility of musical instruments using Matlab - Bachelor thesis

Here you will find my Bachelor thesis, a study on acoustic compatibility between music instruments.
Although it may seem brief, the Physics faculty of the University of Barcelona accepts a maximum amount of 5 pages per thesis. 
It was actually hard to sum everything up in that limited amount of pages

If interested, I recommend to read the PDF document first, and then take a look at the code :)
