Study of acoustic compatibility of musical instruments using Matlab - Bachelor thesis

Here you will find my Bachelor thesis, a study on musical timbre and compatibility among music instruments, using the fast fourier transformation algorithm. During this project we defined a mathematical tool to evaluate the acoustic compatiblity between music instruments playing especific pieces.

Although it may seem brief, the Physics faculty of the University of Barcelona accepts a maximum amount of 5 pages per thesis. 
It was actually hard to sum everything up in that limited amount of pages

You will also find two audio files, these are examples of what our mathematical tool would define as good compatibility and bad compatibility.

If interested, I recommend to read the PDF document first, and then take a look at the code :)
